# auto-clip-sorter
Classify video game clips and sort them by game using machine learning.
If you are like me then you have hundreds or even thousands of clips that are unorganized, unnamed, and just plain out disorderly. The goal of this project is to train a neural network on my own clips, classified per game. Then hopefully one can import a video into the network and it will correctly identify the game and sort it into a folder for you.
